#Instructions for Running Project Locally
##Backend:
```bash
The backend is a Maven SpringBoot application, and can be found at the following link https://github.com/birdpersson/isa4.

It can be started normally as a Java project in Eclipse or IntelliJ (run ServerApplication.java as Java Application).
Java 11 was used.
PostgreSQL is needed for the Backend.
Local database connection settings can be found in the application.properties file (src/main/resources/application.properties):
```

##Frontend:
```bash
The frontend is an Angular application, and can be found at the following link https://github.com/mandy94/BloodDonationCenter.

It can be started by running:
npm install --force and then
ng serve in the containing folder.
Further installation details can be found at https://github.com/mandy94/BloodDonationCenter.

so that requests from the Frontend are directed to a Backend that is launched locally and not to one that was deployed on Heroku.
```
